# Investigate-a-Dataset
This project done in order to succeed the Udacity Data analyst nanodegree. In this project I go through the data analysis process, and I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. In addition, I ask questions and answered them with a given dataset, as well as present the results of the analysis.
# The dataset used 
in this project i used the dataset "TMDb movie data". This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. I investigate the dataset to look for intresting patterns and trends and tried to make assumptions of what is make a movie successful.

# Conclusions
> I find that the Drama movies is the most common genre in the dataset. Then after Drama there is Action and then Comedy.
> Action movies is the most popular movie type. Then after Action there is Adventure and then Science Fiction.

> Based on the analysis the movie with the lowest revenue is (Boy) and the movie with the highest revenue is (Avatar)

> Also the movie with highest profit is (Avatar) and the movie with lowest profit is (Boy). and its the same result of the question 3 (what movie has the lowest and highest revenue?). Which means if the revenue increase then the profit increase.

> The average budget for the movies is: 52003492.35 Dollars

> The relationship between the revenue and popularity weak relationship.

> I observe that the movies with higher revenue is received more votes

> The amount of movies released each year has been increased over the time. and it shows a drop of released movies in 2012,2013 and it start increasing after this drop.

> The actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Ralph Fiennes, Johnny Depp) are participate in more than 3 high revenue movies.
